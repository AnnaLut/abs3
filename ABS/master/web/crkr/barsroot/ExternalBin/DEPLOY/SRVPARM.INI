This keyword is equivalent to using SQLTalk's SET ACTIVITYLOG command. These messages are helpful when debugging, but they are not meant to be logged in a production environment. Logging incurs overhead, and the log file can become large very quickly if your site is an active one. To write the messages to a file called debug.txt: log=d:\test\debug.txt.

Enabling asynchronous disk I/O means that SQLBase Servers for OS/2, Sun Unix, and UnixWare start a separate thread which is responsible for all disk I/O. While this thread is performing disk I/O activities, the main SQLBase thread is running other CPU operations. Enabling asynchronous disk input/output thereby improves performance.

The larger the cache, the less the disk input and output. You should experiment with various cache values to determine the best setting. The best setting is that which maximizes the performance of your applications.
1;1;2;SQLPCCK;36  ;1048512 ;600;2;1;          ;Client Check          ;CLIENTCHECK     ;Tells SQLBase to send the client a RECEIVE upon receipt of a request. By default, clientcheck is off (0). When SQLBase has finished executing a command, it issues a SEND request to the client with the results of the command. If successful, the server then issues a RECEIVE request and waits to receive another command. Setting clientcheck on (1) instructs SQLBase to issue a RECEIVE request before beginning execution of the command, not after it finishes executing the command. Doing so allows SQLBase to detect a situation where the client session is dropped or a cancel request is made during command processing. 
1;1;1;SQLPCTL;1010;33554368;514;2;3; seconds  ;Command Time Limit    ;CMDTIMEOUT      ;Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE command to complete the prepare and execution part of the command.

SQLBase supports English as the standard language, but it also supports many national languages including those spoken in Europe and Asia. You specify information that enables SQLBase to support another language in the country.sql file. This file contains a section for each country that SQLBase supports, and the section name is the country name as coded for the country keyword in sql.ini. To support French: country=france.

For partitioned databases, dbdir indicates the location of the MAIN database when you create the first partitioned database. A home database directory contains a subdirectory which in turn contains one or more database files. The name of the subdirectory must be the same as the database file name without the extension. For example, the home database directory for the demo.dbs file is \demo. By default, \sqlbase is the home database directory. Override this default by specifying a different value for the dbdir keyword. You can specify a path with one or more directories. The maximum length of the dbdir value is 255 characters. The format is the same as for the DOS path command: dbdir=d:\sqlbase;d:\devel;d:\test Note that the home database directories are specified with a drive letter and path name.

Direct input/output improves performance on large databases, and the performance improvement increases with the size of the database. DOS disk file input/output degrades as files get larger. Enabling directio specifies that SQLBase should continue to use ordinary DOS input/output to create, open, and increase the size of database files, but that SQLBase should bypass the DOS file system in reading and writing directly to disk.

The default for most platforms is 2, and for NetWare and UNIX is 10. SQLBase tries to economize resources and increase transaction rates by grouping COMMITs from several transactions into one transaction log entry, and performing them all in one physical write. It does this by pausing for a fraction of a moment in anticipation of other incoming COMMIT requests. SQLBase does not defer COMMITs; it always writes a COMMIT to disk before returning control to the user. 
1;1;2;SQLPGCD;1008;33554431;600;2;3; ticks    ;Group Commit Delay    ;GROUPCOMMITDELAY;Specifies the maximum number of system ticks that SQLBase waits until actually performing COMMITs. The meaning of 'tick' is platform-dependent, but is approximately 1/20 of a second.
